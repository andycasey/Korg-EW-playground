Abstract:
    The compositions of stars are a critical diagnostic tool for many
    topics in astronomy such as the evolution of our Galaxy, the formation
    of planets, and the uniqueness of the Sun. Previous spectroscopic
    measurements indicate a large intrinsic variation in the elemental
    abundance patterns of stars with similar overall metal content.
    However, systematic errors arising from inaccuracies in stellar models
    are known to be a limiting factor in such studies, and thus it is
    uncertain to what extent the observed diversity of stellar abundance
    patterns is real. Here we report the abundances of 30 elements with
    precisions of 2% for 79 Sun-like stars within 100pc. Systematic errors
    are minimized in this study by focusing on solar twin stars and
    performing a line-by-line differential analysis using high-resolution,
    high-signal-to-noise spectra. We resolve [X/Fe] abundance trends in
    galactic chemical evolution at precisions of 10^-3^dex/Gyr and reveal
    that stars with similar ages and metallicities have nearly identical
    abundance patterns. Contrary to previous results, we find that the
    ratios of carbon-to-oxygen and magnesium-to-silicon in
    solar-metallicity stars are homogeneous to within 10% throughout the
    solar neighborhood, implying that exoplanets may exhibit much less
    compositional diversity than previously thought. Finally, we
    demonstrate that the Sun has a subtle deficiency in refractory
    material relative to >80% of solar twins (at 2{sigma} confidence),
    suggesting a possible signpost for planetary systems like our own.

Description:
    To achieve sufficient signal-to-noise for high-precision abundance
    work, we stacked >=50 observations for each star. All spectra were
    taken with the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS)
    spectrograph on the 3.6m telescope of the European Southern
    Observatory (ESO), located at La Silla Observatory in Chile; with
    resolving power R=115000 and wavelength coverage between 378-691nm.
    A majority of the selected sample were observed by us in the course of
    a large ESO observing program on HARPS (Melendez+ 2015Msngr.161...28M).
    Other stars had a sufficient number of publicly available spectra in
    the online ESO Science Archive Facility.

    The solar reference spectrum used in this work was created by
    combining multiple exposures of sunlight reflected from the asteroid
    Vesta. It was continuum-normalized in the same manner as the target
    spectra and has S/N~1300/pix at 600nm.

    Spectra previously obtained with the MIKE spectrograph and analyzed in
    Ramirez+ (2014A&A...572A..48R) were also used in some parts of this
    analysis. These spectra have S/N~400/pix at 600nm, resolution
    R=83000-65000 (on blue/red CCDs), and wavelength coverage between 320
    and 1000nm.
